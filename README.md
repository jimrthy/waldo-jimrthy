# Waldo Photos Engineering Project

The goal of this project is to produce a working system that can be used as a conversation piece during your on-site interview. Be prepared to:

* Present your solution to a group of smart engineers like yourself.
* Talk about the decisions that went into the creation of your solution. 
* Explain how you see the solution evolving over time. 
* Discuss the runtime characteristics of the system.
* Discuss technical design tradeoffs and the cost-benefit analysis of those decisions.

### Deliverable

Using any language and data-store of your choice, write a console application that takes two arguments. The arguments are locations of two image files.

Example:
```bash
subimage ./images/image1.jpeg ./images/image2.jpeg 
```

The application should return information if one of the images is a cropped part of the other one. If yes, the application should also return the position of top-left
corner of the cropped image within the original image.

Notes:
 - The images may be provided in any order (the cropped image may be the first or the second).
 - The application should work well on JPEGs with some lossy compression enabled.

You can make any additional assumptions, as long as you are explicit about these. 

Please deliver the finished project in a publicly available repository on Github. Please title the repository as `waldo-${ github-handle }`.

Deliveries via private repos, BitBucket, or anything other than what is specified above will be disqualified.

### Evaluation

The main areas we will be evaluating are:

- organization of responsibility
- performance
- resilience to failures.
